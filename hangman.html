        <h2>Hangman Game</h2>
        <img
         src="assets/images/hangman_image.jpg"
         alt="alex-deluera"

         class="img1"

    <br>    
    <p>
        I'm excited to share my journey in developing this simple and classic word-guessing 
        game, Hangman, using the power of C#. This project started as part of a course on C# 
        and expanded as I continued to learn more about programming and developed confidence 
        in logically setting up nested loops.The goal was to create an interactive, user-friendly 
        experience that captures the essence of this timeless game and brings it to the digital 
        world. Using C#'s versatility and SQLite's simplicity to build a Hangman game that's 
        both enjoyable and exciting. Follow along as I explain this project in 13 simple, 
        easy-to-follow steps:
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1>
        1. Define an Array of Words:
    </h1>
    
    <img
        src="assets/images/Hangman1.png"
        alt="Hangman1"
        loading="lazy"
        width="80%"
        class="img2"
    />
    <p>
        An array of words is defined, which will be used to populate a SQLite database.
    </p>
    <h1>
        2. Define a Connection String and Create Database, if applicable:
    </h1>
    <img
        src="assets/images/Hangman2.png"
        alt="Hangman1"
        loading="lazy"
        width="50%"
        class="img2"
    />
    <p>
        This connection string specifies the SQLite database file name as "mydatabase.db." This 
        section of code can also create a SQLite database file, of the same name, if the user 
        has not created one yet.
    </p>
    <h1>
        3. SQLite Database Connection:
    </h1>
    <p>
        The code establishes a connection to the SQLite database:
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
            <li>“SQLiteConnection” is used to open and manage the 
                database connection.</li>
            <li>The “using” statement ensures that the connection 
                is properly disposed of when done.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h1>
        4. Create a Table:
    </h1>
    <img
        src="assets/images/Hangman3.png"
        alt="Hangman1"
        loading="lazy"
        width="75%"
        class="img2"
    />
    <p>
        This block of code creates an SQLite table named "NameTable" if it doesn't already exist. 
        The table has two columns: "Id" and "Name". The "Id" column is an auto-incrementing primary 
        key, and the "Name" column contains unique text values.
    </p>
    <h1>
        5. Insert Data Into Table:
    </h1>
    <img
        src="assets/images/Hangman4.png"
        alt="Hangman1"
        loading="lazy"
        width="60%"
        class="img2"
    />
    <p>
        This code inserts the words from the "words" array into the "NameTable". It uses parameterized 
        queries to avoid SQL injection, which demonstrates an effort to ensure database security. The 
        "INSERT or IGNORE" statement prevents duplicate entries in the "Name" column.
    </p>
    <h1>
        6. Close the Database Connection:
    </h1>
    <p>
        The database connection is properly closed to release resources.
    </p>
    <h3>
        NOTE: The following steps are completed in the HangmanMain.cs file as listed in the Github Repository, 
        not the Database.cs file.
    </h3>
    <br>
    <h1>
        7. Main Method:
    </h1>
    <img
        src="assets/images/Hangman5.png"
        alt="Hangman1"
        loading="lazy"
        width="30%"
        class="img2"
    />
    <p>
        The "Main" method is the entry point of the program where the hangman game is played.
    </p>
    <h1>
        8. Database Connection:
    </h1>
    <img
        src="assets/images/Hangman6.png"
        alt="Hangman1"
        loading="lazy"
        width="55%"
        class="img2"
    />
    <p>
        The code establishes a connection to an SQLite database located in the file "mydatabase.db". 
        It selects a random word from the "NameTable" and stores it in the "name" variable.
    </p>
    <h1>
        9. Hidden Word Initialization:
    </h1>
    <img
        src="assets/images/Hangman7.png"
        alt="Hangman1"
        loading="lazy"
        width="30%"
        class="img2"
    />
    <p>
        This initializes the "hidden" variable with asterisks, representing each letter of the "name" 
        that the player has to guess.
    </p>
    <h1>
        10. Game Loop:
    </h1>
    <img
    src="assets/images/Hangman8.PNG"
    alt="Hangman8"
    loading="lazy"
    width="50%"
    class="img2"
    />
    <p>
        The game loop runs as long as there are asterisks in the "hidden" word. This loop allows the 
        player to guess letters and updates the "hidden" word accordingly.
    </p>
    <h1>
        11. Guess Validation:
    </h1>
    <p> User input can be fickle, so the code takes the following steps to validate the guess input and 
        ensure smooth game flow:
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
            <li>The code validates the player's input and ensures 
                it's a valid letter.</li>
            <li>If the player guesses the entire word, the game ends 
                and displays a winning message.</li>
            <li>If the player's input is not a single letter, they 
                are prompted to try again.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h1> 
        12. Updating the Hidden Word:
    </h1>
    <p> As the user inputs guesses, the hidden word will be updated on-screen to track progress and 
        aid informed guesses:
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
            <li>The code updates the "hidden" word based on correct 
                guesses. It replaces asterisks with the guessed letters, maintaining the same letter 
                case as the original word.</li>
            <li>If the guessed letter is correct and appears multiple 
                times in the "name", it updates all occurrences.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h1>
        13. Game Result:
    </h1>
    <div class="video-container">
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/53qjpAuW8F4?si=3UR2E59PGpDKLkHU" 
         title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; 
         encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen>
        </iframe>
    </div>
    <p>
        After the game loop ends, the code checks if the player has successfully guessed the word. If 
        so, it displays a success message! The game may be used as is to allow unlimited guesses to players, 
        or may be updated to implement a maximum number of guesses, using a for loop that is commented out 
        on line 55.

        Overall, this code implements a simple hangman game that retrieves a random word from a database, allows 
        the player to guess letters, and updates the display until they either complete the word or run out of 
        guesses. The code demonstrates the use of parameterized queries to ensure database security, and provides 
        error handling to avoid multiple entries.
