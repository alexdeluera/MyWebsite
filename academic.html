    <p>
      I am currently a junior studying Computer Science at the University of Florida, 
      maintaining a 4.0 GPA. Throughout my academic journey, I have excelled in key 
      courses, including Programming Fundamentals 1 and 2, which have provided me with 
      a solid foundation in programming languages such as Python and C++, as well as a 
      strong understanding of algorithms and basic data structures. These courses have 
      sharpened my problem-solving abilities and fueled my passion for coding.
    </p>
    <p>
      This upcoming semester, I will be taking courses in Data Structures and Algorithms 
      and Intro to Computer Organization, which I am excited about as they will allow me 
      to deepen my understanding of core computer science concepts. I look forward to 
      further developing my technical skills and applying them to more complex challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I continue to progress in my studies, I am eager to explore more advanced topics 
      and expand my knowledge in software development. I am committed to growing both 
      academically and professionally, and I am excited for the opportunities that lie ahead.
